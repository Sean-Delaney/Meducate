          <h3 id = 'body'>Meducate is a website designed by a student for students. It is a place where young adults can come to educate themselves on recreational drugs. The website is designed as a Final Year project by Se√°n Delaney, a computer science undergraduate. The reason that I decided to design a website based around this area is due to the startling amount of drug use I see around me, from nightclubs to the streets. There is no doubt in my mind that Ireland has to do more to stop the rapid growth of drug addiction within our society. Having done some research I decided that the best place to try and tackle this problem was where it seems to begin for most people - within their late teens to early twenties. The aim of my project is to provide concise, clear information in  a user friendly manor. I want to make you want to learn why you should stay away from these substances, rather than scare you away.</h3>
