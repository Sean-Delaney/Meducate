# Meducate
A website designed as my Final Year Project - aimed at harm reduction in college students around drugs.

To start meducate on your own device (You must have node.js installed already).

  - Download the source code.
  - Navigate to the directory where the source code is downloaded
  - cd into Meducate and then Server, open a terminal and run npm install.
  - cd back out of the Server directory and into the Client directory, again run npm install in a terminal
  - cd into the meducate directory inside of Client and run npm install again
  - Stay in the meducate directory and run npm run build
  - Once the build has finished, navigate back to the Server directory and run npm start.
  - That's it! You will now be able to see the web app on localhost:3001.
